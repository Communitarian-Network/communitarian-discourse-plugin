Professor Etzioni taught at Columbia, Harvard, and Berkley, and was a Senior Advisor to the Carter White House. His books include The Spirit of Community and Reclaiming Patriotism.

          title: The Civil Dialogues platform for civil agreement on the most pressing issues
          text: Civil Dialogues is an online agora, a place people meet to deliberate and to form a consensus on urgent matters. No aliases, no fakes; only people who are willing to show their true face. Identities are verified. A place to allow the kind of continued, extended deliberations that democracy requires. A site to make a record once consensus has been reached. A platform on which online communities are formed that carry over offline.
